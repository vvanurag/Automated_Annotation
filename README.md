Automated Annotation using Grounded SAM and the likes

## Discovery line
Autodistil: Autodistill uses big, slower foundation models to train small, faster supervised models
            You can use Autodistill on your own hardware, or use the Roboflow hosted version of Autodistill to label images in the cloud.

Roboflow Auto Label (beta): Many of the top models used in production today like YOLOv9, Ultralytics YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS require
                                 fine-tuning on hundreds or thousands of labeled images to achieve the accuracy necessary for production systems.
                                 Auto labels use foundation models like Grpinded Dino, Grounded SAM, which are slow to use in production but are
